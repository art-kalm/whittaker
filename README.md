## whittaker

This is a small code that computes Whittaker vector for certain Harish-Chandra bimodules using the Kirillov projector, see the `kirillov_projector.pdf` in the repository.

## Usage

To use it, install `sage` and start it from the `whittaker` folder, then run

```

```

Examples of usage can be found in `examples.ipynb` that requires `jupyter-notebook` to start.
